                    AI automation technology continues evolving at remarkable pace. Emerging trends will further transform automation capabilities:
                </p>

                <h3>Advanced AI and Machine Learning</h3>
                <p>
                    Next-generation AI models will enable more sophisticated decision-making, improved natural language understanding, and predictive capabilities. Autonomous systems will handle increasingly complex processes with minimal human oversight.
                </p>

                <h3>Hyperautomation</h3>
                <p>
                    Hyperautomation combines RPA, AI, and advanced analytics to automate end-to-end business processes spanning multiple systems and applications. Organizations will move beyond automating individual tasks toward automating entire business processes.
                </p>

                <h3>Intelligent Process Mining</h3>
                <p>
                    Process mining technologies will automatically discover, visualize, and analyze business processes, identifying optimization and automation opportunities. This will democratize process improvement, enabling organizations to identify automation opportunities systematically.
                </p>
